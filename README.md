# Food-Recommendation-System-for-Diabetes-Patient
Food recommendation system which suggests recipes or foods based on user preferences.

### Aim of the project
The aim of this project is to recommend proper foods for diabetic patients. Empowering individuals with diabetes, this platform enables patients to effortlessly
select their preferences from a comprehensive list and seamlessly update their personalized choices.

### Background
<p text-align="justify">Diabetes is a huge problem. The number of diabetic patients increases each year by millions. And can you imagine only for the year 2022 the health expenditure for diabetes was more than 966 billion USD? Not only that.
According to the research, 1 in 10 adults has diabetes and 1 death per every 5 seconds worldwide. Even in Bangladesh, one in five adults has either diabetes or prediabetes. So how can we get rid of this? Unfortunately, according to medical professionals, there is no cure yet. The only thing, we can do is to control diabetes, especially by avoiding unhealthy foods. So how can we scientifically ensure whether a particular food is healthy or not for diabetes? <br>
We have developed an Online Food Recommendation System for diabetes patients.</p>

### Expected Outcomes
- Suggest which food is suitable or not for diabetes patients based on user preference.
- Develop a user-friendly interface to access the recommendation system.
